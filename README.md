# hello-world
This is my introductory project for Github to familiarize myself with the site and format of work done within Github. This is a great refresher from the Hello World projects I did when learning BASIC about 20 years ago. 
Throughout the completion of this project, I see how this can be a useful tool for collaboration between employees and project coordinators both remotely from anywhere in the world, or within the same building. This cuts down on the need for large meeting rooms, confusing video conferences, and other less organized means of collaboration and idea sharing.
